# PeriProt

Periprot1.0 is a sofware built to analysis Peripheral Membrane Proteins (PMPs) structure or Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation data. Periprot can only analyse date from NAMD or CHARMM simulation (PSF format for the topology and dcd format for the trajectory). 

The available analysis are:

 - Hydrogen bond network analysis (MD)
 - Hydrophobic contact analysis (MD)
 - Cation-Pi interaction analysis (MD)
 - Depth of Anchoring (MD)
 - Protein - Membrane Distances (MD)
 - Electron Density Profil (MD)
 - Macrodipole (PDB structure)

 # Depth of Anchoring
 
Periprot can be use to calculate the average depth of anchoring (DOA) of each residue in the bilayer. The DOA here represent the distance from the carbon alpha (CA) of the residue and the average phosphate plane. I the CA is below the phosphate plane the DOA will be negative.

The output files:
 - a csv file ("example_depth_of_anchoring.csv") containg the average DOA and the associated standard deviation for each residue
 - A figure ("example_depth_of_anchoring.png") with the average DOA vs the residue number.
 - A PDB file ("example_depth_of_anchoring.pdb"). If a PDB file is given on the command line, a new PDB file will be created with the average average DOA during the MD as the B-factor.

 # Hydrophobic contact analysis
 
In Periprot, an hydrophobic contact are consider between to candidates atom (one from the protein and one from the bilayer) if there distance are less than 3 Ã…. The candidates atom can be picked automatiocally or the user can give his own candidates list.

usage: python PeriProt.py -top mydata.psf -traj mydata.dcd -pdb mydata.pdb -hydro -out example

The output files:
 - a csv file ("example_hydrophobic_contact_raw_data.csv") contating the raw data (all hydrophobic contact in all frame)
 - a csv file ("example_average_hydrophobic_contact_per_frame.csv") containg the average number of hydrophobic contact per residues
 - a PDB file ("example__average_hydrophobic_contact_per_frame.pdb"). If a PDB file is given on the command line, a new PDB file will be created with the average number of hydrophobic contact as the B-factor.
